Hi there, I'm _Saurav Ojha_!


I’m a data analyst with a strong background in statistical analysis and machine learning. I have a passion for turning data into actionable insights and love working on projects that have a real-world impact.


When I’m not analyzing data, you can find me learning languages, creating digital contents or composing music. I also enjoy photography and exploring nature.

I’m excited to share my projects and collaborate with others in the data community!
